[verse]
A
   It's 3:45 (AM)
C#m
   And I just bite my tongue
E
   Update me on your life
Caug
   And now you've found the one
A
   But I don't like his eyes
C#m
   And I distrust their name
E
   And I hate their haircut
Caug
   They look like a prick (A prick)
A
   But it's all the same
C#m
   Would be daft of me to cry
E
   Your tongue is razor sharp
Caug
   I miss when it would fight mine
A
   Left your heart on standby
C#m
   By the way he holds you
E
   Bet he serenades you
Caug              Caug
   I can't really blame you


[chorus]
                                    E A G# G#
And I can still smell her perfume
                                    E A G# G#
Did it rub off on you?
                                    E A G# G#
And I can still smell her perfume
                                    E A G# G#
Did it rub off on you?

[post-chorus]
A                 C#m
  You say your ex-boyfriend's a policeman
E                 Caug
  Well, I say you need better standards
A                 C#m
  You say your ex-boyfriend's a policeman
E                 Caug
  I say you need better standards


[verse]
A
   It seems like all her friends
C#m
   Abruptly fell in love
E
   And she was in the dust
Caug
   Stalling; life was streaming past
A
   So she learnt to lie
C#m
   She learnt how to pretend
E
   A drama in the futile
Caug
   A means to an end
A
   Why can't you be a dick?
C#m
   Why must you be so nice?
E
   It's hard for me to move on
Caug                   A
   When I don't really hate you

[pre-chorus]
C#m
(I don't really hate you)
E
(I don't really hate you)
Caug
(I don't really hate you)

[chorus]
                                    E A G# G#
And I can still smell her perfume
                                    E A G# G#
Did it rub off on you?
                                    E A G# G#
And I can still smell her perfume
                                    E A G# G#
Did it rub off on you?

[outro]
A
  It's 3:45
C#m
  Your taxi's not arrived
E
  I don't think that he's coming 

Caug~
