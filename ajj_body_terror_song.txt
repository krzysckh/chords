       d                G              C
I'm so sorry that you have to have a body
        d               G             C         F
I'm so sorry that you have to have a body, oh yeah
         d               G            C
I'm very sorry that you have to have a body


               E7                 a             G            F
One that will hurt you and be the subject of so much of your fear
   F
It will betray you
          E7
Be used against you
              a              G
Then it will fail on you, my dear
       C                      E7
But before that, you'll be a doormat
           a            G            F
For every vicious narcissist in the world
                d                    E7
Oh, how they'll screw you all up and over
              a             G
Then feed you silence for dessert


d     G    C    d     G    C


        d               G              C
I'm so sorry that you have to have a body
         d               G              C         F
So very sorry that you have to have a body, oh yeah
     d               G              a
I'm sorry that you have to have a body


               E7
Filled with infection
              F
One hundred scabs
           D
Singing in unison
          a
Eyes and hands
           E7
Sometimes bullets
     F
Uninvited
           D        a  E7
Passing through us
     F
Uninvited
           D
Passing through us


     a             F              G    a
I'm sorry that you have to have a body
        a             F              G    a
I'm so sorry that you have to have a body
