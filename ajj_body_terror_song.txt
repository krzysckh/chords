AJJ - Body Terror Song

Dm    G    C

       Dm               G              C
I'm so sorry that you have to have a body
        Dm              G             C         F
I'm so sorry that you have to have a body, oh yeah
         Dm              G            C
I'm very sorry that you have to have a body


               E7                 Am             G            F
One that will hurt you and be the subject of so much of your fear
   F
It will betray you
          E7
Be used against you
              Am              G
Then it will fail on you, my dear
       C                      E7
But before that, you'll be a doormat
           Am            G            F
For every vicious narcissist in the world
                Dm                   E7
Oh, how they'll screw you all up and over
              Am             G
Then feed you silence for dessert


Dm    G    C    Dm    G    C


        Dm              G              C
I'm so sorry that you have to have a body
         Dm              G              C         F
So very sorry that you have to have a body, oh yeah
     Dm              G              Am
I'm sorry that you have to have a body


               E7
Filled with infection
              F
One hundred scabs
           D
Singing in unison
          Am
Eyes and hands
           E7
Sometimes bullets
     F
Uninvited
           D        Am  E7
Passing through us
     F
Uninvited
           D
Passing through us


     Am             F              G    Am
I'm sorry that you have to have a body
        Am             F              G    Am
I'm so sorry that you have to have a body
