      C        e7
I see trees of green
F*            e7
   Red roses too
d7            C
   I see them bloom
E7            a
   For me and for you
      Gis
And I think to myself
d7        G7        C
   What a wonderful world

I see skies of blue
And clouds of white
The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

    d7            G7
The colors of the rainbow

So pretty in the sky

Of people going by

I see friends shaking hands
        a*          G*
Saying, "How do you do?"
     a*        G*
They're really saying
d7      G7
"I love you"

I hear babies cry
F              C
  I watch them grow
d7                   C
  They'll learn much more
E7               a
  Than I'll ever know

And I think to myself
